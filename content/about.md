## Hobbies

### Homelab

![12u open-air rack](/images/technis-rack.JPG)

Running all sorts of hardware and software with a focus on [Infrastructure as Code](https://github.com/jovalle/technis).

This rack was augmented with a bamboo top I put together to match the greater aesthetic.

At times I wish for a closed-air rack. Maybe one of those fancy sealed ones with ample ventilation and noise
reduction. 🤑

From top to bottom:

- R730xd running Proxmox mostly for a virtualized TrueNAS SCALE. Hosts my perpetually growing collection of media,
including photos, old movies/shows and tons of ISOs.
- (MS-01 x3) HA Proxmox cluster with 25GbE networking via Thunderbolt, NVMe drives managed by Ceph and a production-grade
Kubernetes ([Talos](https://www.talos.dev/)) cluster atop (among a ton of other VMs and LXCs distributed).
- 2.5GbE switch with a few SFP+ ports for max powaaaa.
- Couple of Tripp Lite UPSes for power outage protection (up to 30-60min).

Out of frame:

- Raspberry Pi running network services (see [Stargate](https://github.com/jovalle/stargate))

Some services are exposed to the internet for access on-the-go and sharing with family and friends.

### Sim Racing

![Love zooming to this song](/images/gt-sim.png)

~~Fanatec fanatic. Playing as Lamborghini (custom team to fuel my dislike of Ferrari) in F1 22 My Team.~~
Sold my gear in early 2024.

### Guitar

![Fender bender](/images/fender-bender.jpeg)

I dabble on covers of random songs recreated by ear. Still can't memorize a chord (by name) for my life.

~~Mostly arpeggios and Rocksmith 2014. Cannot memorize a chord for my life.~~
