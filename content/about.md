## Hobbies

### Homelabbing
Running a few Kubernetes clusters across a diverse fleet of hardware:

- A multi-arch (amd64/arm64), hybrid (baremetal + VMs) Kubernetes cluster using a couple of Intel/AMD PCs, a handful of Raspberry Pis and VMs on 2U server. [Infrastructure as Code](https://github.com/jovalle/technis). Used to host my go-to applications including open-sources services for automating things around the house.
- TrueNAS SCALE on vSphere. Hosts my perpetually growing collection of media, including photos, old movies and tons of ISOs.

Some services are exposed to the internet for access on the go and sharing with family and friends. Using [HAProxy](/posts/multi-cluster-haproxy) to join the two clusters under the same domain.

### Sim Racing
Fanatec fanatic. Currently playing as Lamborghini (custom team, I dislike Ferrari) in F1 22 My Team.

### (Semi-)Electric Guitars
Mostly arpeggios and Rocksmith 2014. Cannot memorize a chord for my life.
